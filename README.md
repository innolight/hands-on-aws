# AWS Patterns

In this project, I try to gain deep and hands-on knowledge of architecting application in AWS by using CDK to implement
popular architectural patterns in AWS.

## Patterns

Discover AWS patterns in folder [patterns](./patterns):


- [x] [`s3-polished-configuration`](./patterns/s3-polished-configuration): S3 with encryption, versioning enabled, lifecycle rule, data archiver with Glacier
- [x] [`s3-events-notification`](./patterns/s3-events-notification): S3 → SNS → SQS → SQS (DLQ) 
- [x] [`s3-cross-region-replication`](./patterns/s3-cross-region-replication): S3 → S3 (another region); Multi-region Access Point for S3
- [ ] `s3-static-website-cloudfront`: S3 hosting a static website, using CloudFront for global delivery
- [ ] `s3-lambda-rekognition-dynamodb`: image processing pipeline and metadata storage

- [ ] `athena-query-s3`: AWS Athena querying structured/unstructured data from S3
- [ ] `glue-etl-job`: AWS Glue ETL job that processes and transforms data in S3 to different format
- [ ] `rds-backup-and-recovery`: Set up automated backups and point-in-time recovery for RDS
- [ ] `rds-two-readable-standbys`: Multi-AZ deployment of RDS with 2 readable standby instance
- [ ] `rds-aurora-cross-region-replication`: RDS Aurora Cross-Region replication + Write Forwarding
- [ ] `rds-aurora-serverless-v2`: Deploying Aurora Serverless v2 with autoscaling
- [ ] `rds-proxy`: RDS proxy in front of RDS

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- AWS CLI configured with valid credentials (`aws configure`)
- AWS CDK CLI (included via `npx cdk`)

### Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
```

CDK automatically resolves `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` and `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION` from your AWS CLI profile (`aws configure`). To target a specific region:

```bash
export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1
```

### Project Structure

```
bin/cdk.ts                        # Entry point — registers all CDK stacks
patterns/<name>/
  ├── stack.ts                    # CDK Stack class (or stack_step*.ts for multi-step patterns)
  ├── README.md                   # Pattern-specific notes
  ├── cloud_formation.yaml        # Synthesized CloudFormation output
  ├── demo_server.ts              # (Optional) Express server to demo the pattern
  └── demo_requests.http          # (Optional) HTTP requests for the demo server
utils/
  └── stackoutput.ts              # getStackOutputs(stackName) — discovers deployed resources at runtime
```

### CDK Workflow

**Stage 1 — Environment setup (once per account/region)**

- `npx cdk bootstrap` — provisions the S3 bucket and IAM resources CDK needs to store assets (Lambda packages, templates) during deployment. Run once per AWS account + region before first deploy.

**Stage 2 — Development**

- `npx cdk ls` — list all stacks defined in the app; confirms the code compiles and shows what's available to deploy.
- `npx cdk synth <StackName>` — compile your CDK code into a CloudFormation template (written to `cdk.out/`). Use this to inspect what will actually be deployed or catch errors early.

**Stage 3 — Review**

- `npx cdk diff <StackName>` — compare your local code against what's currently deployed. Like `git diff` for infrastructure — always run this before deploying to see exactly what will be added, changed, or deleted.

**Stage 4 — Deploy**

- `npx cdk deploy <StackName>` — upload assets to the bootstrap bucket and apply the CloudFormation template to your AWS account.

**Stage 5 — Teardown**

- `npx cdk destroy <StackName>` — delete the CloudFormation stack and all resources within it. Prompts for confirmation before deleting.

> **Note:** All patterns use `removalPolicy: DESTROY` and `autoDeleteObjects: true` for easy cleanup. These settings are **not production-safe**.

### Adding a New Pattern

1. Create `patterns/<name>/stack.ts` — extend `cdk.Stack`, export a stack name constant, and use `CfnOutput` for key resource IDs/ARNs
2. Register the stack in `bin/cdk.ts`
3. (Optional) Add `demo_server.ts` using `getStackOutputs()` to discover resources at runtime
4. Add a `README.md` in the pattern folder
5. Synthesize the template: `npx cdk synth <StackName> > patterns/<name>/cloud_formation.yaml`

### Running Demo Servers

```bash
AWS_REGION=eu-central-1 npx ts-node patterns/<name>/demo_server.ts
```

Demo servers use `getStackOutputs()` from `utils/stackoutput.ts` to discover deployed resource names and ARNs at runtime — no hardcoding needed. Deploy the pattern stack first, then start the server.

### Useful Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `pnpm run build` | Compile TypeScript to JS |
| `pnpm run watch` | Watch for changes and compile |
| `pnpm run test` | Run Jest unit tests |
| `npx cdk synth` | Emit synthesized CloudFormation template |
| `npx cdk diff` | Compare deployed stack with current state |
| `npx cdk deploy` | Deploy stack to your default AWS account/region |
| `npx cdk destroy` | Tear down a deployed stack |
